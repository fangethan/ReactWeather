# ReactWeather

This app allows you to see the current weather of a certain location.\
The get weather tab allows you to see the weather of a certain location, displaying the weather in degrees celsius.\
The about tab explains what the app is about.\
The examples tab is a list of cities that when click, can show the weather of those cities.\
The country code table tab is a list of countries and their code so users can easily type the correct country code in the search bar.\
When entering a city, you can also add in the country code. This is to help if certain cities have the same city name but different country such as Melbourne in Australia and the USA.\
To enter both city name and country code, follow the following: (cityName, countryCode) -> Melbourne, AU using the comma to separate the text.\
App gets the weather temperature from https://openweathermap.org/ .\
Upcoming additions:.\
Button to convert to fahrenheit.\
Show more than just current degrees, more than 7 days etc.\
Map of the world through Google Maps

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
